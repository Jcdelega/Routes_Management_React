# 🩺 Medical Appointment SPA

A modern single-page application (SPA) built with **React**, **Vite**, and **React Router DOM**. This project provides a smooth and intuitive experience for managing medical appointments and navigating between views with dynamic routing.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to **apply and reinforce the use of `react-router-dom`** to handle static and dynamic routes, including:
- Navigation between different views
- Use of URL parameters

## 🏥 Project: Medical Appointment Management Platform

In many clinics and private practices, appointment scheduling is often done manually or using inefficient systems. This leads to missed appointments, scheduling confusion, and difficulty accessing patient data.

This project aims to build a **web platform in React** that allows **patients and doctors** to manage appointments efficiently, using `react-router-dom` for seamless navigation across the application.
